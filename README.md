# Julep-foodie-tour-ai
# 🍽️ AI Foodie Tour Planner

This project was built using the [Julep AI Agent Platform](https://julep.ai), leveraging OpenWeather and APIIP APIs to plan a culinary journey across three Indian cities: Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Chennai.

## 🌟 Objective

To dynamically generate a foodie tour itinerary based on real-time weather and location data using AI tools and APIs, all through a no-code interface.

## 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool           | Purpose                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| OpenWeather API| To get real-time weather info    |
| APIIP API      | To get user's IP-based location  |
| Julep Dashboard| To create and run AI Agents      |

## 🧠 How It Works

- The agent first checks the weather conditions using OpenWeather.
- It optionally fetches the user's city using IP (APIIP).
- Based on the weather and selected city, the agent generates a tailored foodie itinerary.
