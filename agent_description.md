- **Platform**: Julep Dashboard (no-code, visual workflow)
- **APIs Used**:
  - **OpenWeather API**: To retrieve real-time weather conditions for each city.

## üîÅ Agent Workflow (High-Level Steps)

1. **User Input**  
   - Prompt: `Plan a foodie tour for the cities: Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai.`
   - The agent accepts city names either directly from the user input or via variable injection in Julep.

2. **Weather Tool (OpenWeather API)**  
   - Fetches current weather data for each city in the tour.
   - Configured with API key via `{{env.OPENWEATHER_API_KEY}}`.

3. **Location Tool (APIIP)** (Optional Step)  
   - Determines user‚Äôs current city based on their IP.
   - Used to personalize or suggest a starting point if not explicitly provided.

4. **Foodie Tour Generation (LLM or Planner Step)**  
   - Using weather data and city name, the agent:
     - Highlights iconic dishes of the city.
     - Plans a food itinerary for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
     - Tailors dining experiences to weather (e.g., indoor dining for hot cities, outdoor for pleasant ones).
   - The plan includes real restaurant recommendations.

5. **Output Response**  
   - A well-formatted, user-friendly response listing dishes and restaurants, one city at a time.
